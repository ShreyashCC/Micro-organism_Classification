# 1. Project Details:

* Topic: Microorganism Classification
* Goal: Creating an API that classifies JPG images of microorganisms and provides feedback with classification results and confidence levels.
* Data: Microorganism image dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdwaquarazam/microorganism-image-classification (8 classes: Amoeba, Euglena, Hydra, Paramecium, Rod_bacteria, Spherical_bacteria, Spiral_bacteria, Yeast)
* Deep Learning Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

# 2. Methodology

## Data Preprocessing

### Loading and Inspecting Data
- Images were loaded using `keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory` into batches of 32 and resized to 256x256 pixels.
- Data was inspected using Matplotlib subplots.

### Image Preprocessing
- Rescaling, resizing, flipping, and rotating were applied using TensorFlow Keras preprocessing functions.

### Data Splitting
- Data was split into 80% training, 10% validation, and 10% test sets before image processing.
- Input pipeline prefetching was used to enhance training performance.

## CNN Architecture

### Model Structure
- **Image Preprocessing Layers:**
    - `resize_and_rescale`: Resizes images and rescales pixel values.
    - `data_augmentation`: Applies data augmentation techniques.
- **Convolutional Layers:**
    - 5 convolutional layers with 32, 64, 64, 64, and 64 filters (3x3 kernel sizes).
    - Each convolutional layer has a ReLU activation function.
- **Max-Pooling Layers:**
    - 5 max-pooling layers (2x2 pool size).
- **Dense Layers:**
    - Flattening layer.
    - Dense layer with 64 units and ReLU activation.
    - Final dense layer with 8 units (8 classes) and softmax activation.

## Training Process

### Training Setup
- TensorFlow and Keras libraries were used.
- GPU acceleration was utilized.

### Training Parameters
- Adam optimizer.
